      "I only had the pleasure of working with Taylor Radtke for four months during his tenure with AAPA as Full Stack Web Developer, Web Designer. I started in March 2018 and Taylor left in July 2018. Despite the short amount of time we worked together, I got to know Taylor, his work ethic, and skills. Along with his exceptionally sharp sense of humor, what impressed me most about Taylor is his dedication to a quality work product regardless of challenges, impediments or limitations.",
      "Taylor was with AAPA for almost two years, acting as the sole in-house resource for website development. Working with internal clients and departments throughout the organization, Taylor was the primary graphic designer and developer for AAPA.org, CHLM.org, pa-foundation.org, aapa.org/conference and yourPAcan.org. With close to 100 staff/contractors within the organization, Taylor and the Senior Digital Product manager collaborated closely to design, develop, deploy and maintain AAPA's websites serving over 50,000 members.",
      "Taylor's passion for his work product is only exceeded by his desire to learn and deliver more. Taylor was a strong creative force for the Web Team and AAPA — designing and delivering beyond what was expected. Taylor has a gift of connecting a user-centric approach to innovative design and thoughtful backend development — rarely do you find that perfect designer/developer blend — yet alone, in someone who can talk sports and geek speak fluently.",
      "As his former supervisor, I would wholeheartedly sing Taylor's praises any day. And I would only be so lucky to have the opportunity to work with him again. If you have any questions about Taylor's skill set, personality, and/or any of the above, do not hesitate to reach out to me. It has been my utmost pleasure working with Taylor and getting to know him. I am confident Taylor will continue to do great things wherever he goes. Thank you for this opportunity to share a few things with you about Taylor.",

Taylor talked to me and got the feel for my product and direction then went to work on the site. He produced a beautiful and professionally done website. Along the way when I neededsome "tweaks" Taylor was receptive but more importantly , Available. The tweaks were done fast and to my complete satisfaction. I recommend Taylor highly .
