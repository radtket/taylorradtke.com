            testimonial={`I am a small start up and I went to Taylor for a website. I am on limited funds and Taylor was able to go from inception to finish on time and on budget. I was very impressed, since being on a limited budget I was expecting a generic basic product but what I received was the opposite. Taylor talked to me and got the feel for my product and direction then went to work on the site. He produced a beautiful and professionally done website. Along the way when I neededsome "tweaks" Taylor was receptive but more importantly , Available. The tweaks were done fast and to my complete satisfaction. I recommend Taylor highly . If you want Champagne on a beer budget then Taylor is your web designer.`}
