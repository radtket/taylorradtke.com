            testimonial={[
              `I only had the pleasure of working with Taylor Radtke for four months during his tenure with AAPA as Full Stack Web Developer, Web Designer. I started in March 2018 and Taylor left in July 2018. Despite the short amount of time we worked together, I got to know Taylor, his work ethic, and skills. Along with his exceptionally sharp sense of humor, what impressed me most about Taylor is his dedication to a quality work product regardless of challenges, impediments or limitations.`,
              `Taylor was with AAPA for almost two years, acting as the sole in-house resource for website development. Working with internal clients and departments throughout the organization, Taylor was the primary graphic designer and developer for AAPA.org, CHLM.org, pa-foundation.org, aapa.org/conference and yourPAcan.org. With close to 100 staff/contractors within the organization, Taylor and the Senior Digital Product manager collaborated closely to design, develop, deploy and maintain AAPA's websites serving over 50,000 members.`,
              `Taylor's passion for his work product is only exceeded by his desire to learn and deliver more. Taylor was a strong creative force for the Web Team and AAPA — designing and delivering beyond what was expected. Taylor has a gift of connecting a user-centric approach to innovative design and thoughtful backend development — rarely do you find that perfect designer/developer blend — yet alone, in someone who can talk sports and geek speak fluently.`,
              `As his former supervisor, I would wholeheartedly sing Taylor's praises any day. And I would only be so lucky to have the opportunity to work with him again. If you have any questions about Taylor's skill set, personality, and/or any of the above, do not hesitate to reach out to me. It has been my utmost pleasure working with Taylor and getting to know him. I am confident Taylor will continue to do great things wherever he goes. Thank you for this opportunity to share a few things with you about Taylor.`

              `"I am a small start up and I went to Taylor for a website. I am on limited funds and Taylor was able to go from inception to finish on time and on budget. I was very impressed, since being on a limited budget I was expecting a generic basic product but what I received was the opposite. Taylor talked to me and got the feel for my product and direction then went to work on the site. He produced a beautiful and professionally done website. Along the way when I neededsome "tweaks" Taylor was receptive but more importantly , Available. The tweaks were done fast and to my complete satisfaction. I recommend Taylor highly . If you want Champagne on a beer budget then Taylor is your web designer."`
